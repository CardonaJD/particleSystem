# particleSystem

“A particle system is a collection of many many minute particles that together represent a fuzzy object. Over a period of time, particles are generated into a system, move and change from within the system, and die from the system.”
—William Reeves, "Particle Systems—A Technique for Modeling a Class of Fuzzy
Objects," ACM Transactions on Graphics 2:2 (April 1983), 92. [Extract from The Nature Of Code]
